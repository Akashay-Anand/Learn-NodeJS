Q) my laptop is new and 64 bit : then why does  'console.log(`Platform: ${process.platform}`); ' command is showing win32

- The process.platform property in Node.js returns the platform that the Node.js process is running on. For Windows, it will always return win32, regardless of whether the system is 32-bit or 64-bit. This is because the Win32 API is the programming interface for all Windows operating systems, including 64-bit systems.

- In your case, if process.platform is showing "win32," it means that Node.js is running on a Windows-based operating system. This is common even on 64-bit laptops because many modern Windows installations, including those on 64-bit hardware, still use the "win32" identifier to represent the Windows platform.
  
- The **process.arch** property can be used to get the architecture of the system that the Node.js process is running on. For a 64-bit Windows system, this will return x64.
